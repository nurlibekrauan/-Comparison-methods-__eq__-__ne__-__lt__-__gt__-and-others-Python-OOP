# -Comparison-methods-__eq__-__ne__-__lt__-__gt__-and-others-Python-OOP
A set of Python classes demonstrating object-oriented capabilities for data comparison, conversion, and validation. Each class performs unique tasks such as time management, currency conversion, validating employee data, and comparing student grades.
# Object-Oriented Python Utilities for Comparison and Conversion

# Object-Oriented Python Utilities for Comparison and Conversion

## Description
This project includes several useful Python classes that implement features such as:
- Comparison operations
- Currency conversion
- Time interval management
- Attribute validation for objects like employees and files

Each file represents a distinct class and supports specific methods for performing comparison operations, mathematical operations, and data validation. This project is ideal for those learning object-oriented programming and operator overloading in Python.

## Contents

### 1. `tx.py` - Class `Student`
   The `Student` class is used to create student objects with a name and grades. Comparison is based on average grade.
   
   **Examples:**
   ```python
   student1 = Student("Alice", [90, 80, 89])
   student2 = Student("Bob", [85, 75, 95])
   print(student1 == student2)  # False
   print(student1 > student2)   # True
### tx2.py - Class TimeInterval
  The TimeInterval class helps manage time intervals and allows addition and subtraction of time intervals.
  ```python
  interval1 = TimeInterval(hours=1, minutes=30)
  interval2 = TimeInterval(hours=2, minutes=15)
  print(interval1 == interval2)  # False
  print(interval1 < interval2)   # True
